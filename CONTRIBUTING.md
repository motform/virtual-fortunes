## Cookie Jar
If you want to add __appropriate__ fortunes to the jar, then be aware of these formatting rules:
* Lines are 80 characters wide for both compa- and readability.
* Fortune bodies start and end with a unicode (")'QUOTATION MARK' (U+0022).
* Fortune context start on a newline with a unicode (")'EM DASH' (U+2014). Author and text follow this newline without a space.
* Fortunes are delimited by a uicode (%)'PERCENT SIGN' (U+0025) on newlines.
* The last fortune in the jar must be delimited by a trailing percent sign.
