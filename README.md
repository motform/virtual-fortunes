# virtual-fortunes from a future past
virtual-fortunes is Unix heresy in the spirit of the The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit.

## Intro

At its core, virtual-fortunes is a stripped down version of Ken Arnold's BSD tool fortune. It parses the cookie jar directly, no index required. By default, it reads the CCRU-cookie jar.

## Installation

Instruction on how to install to PATH should be in here somewhere.

## Usage

Stripped down, shup up, turned around. Tuned and adorned. Ready and wating.
