# virtual-fortunes from a future past

## Intro
At its core, virtual-fortunes is a stripped down version of Ken Arnold's BSD classic [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix). It parses the cookie jar directly, no index required.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/motform/virtual-fortunes.git
$Â cd virtual-fortunes
$ swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
$ cd .build/release
$ cp -f virtualFortunes /usr/local/bin/virtualFortunes
```
To make a the fortunes file into an environmental variable, follow the appropreate instructions for your shell.

```bash
export FORTUNES_FILE="path/to/ccru_fortunes"
```
### Fish
